# WeatherHub WebAPI
Web application used as client for TFA WEATHERHUB SmartHome System meteostation. App is written in PHP (Nette framework) and MySQL. It allows to view charts of temperature and humidity. This app can be easily customized to support more types of sensors.

## Supported sensors
- temperature (not sure if all)
- temperature & humidity (not sure if all)

## Source code
Source code is not public, but let me know if you are interested in this project :)

## Update 2022
They have provided REST API, but it's limited. The most limiting factor is ability to retrieve only last measurement for each sensor (not able to retrieve measurements for whole hour / day etc...)
