# WeatherHub WebAPI
Web application used as client for TFA WEATHERHUB SmartHome System meteostation. App is written in PHP (Nette framework) and MySQL. It allows to view charts of temperature and humidity. This app can be easily customized to support more types of sensors.

## Supported sensors
- temperature (not sure if all)
- temperature & humidity (not sure if all)

## Source code
Source code is not public, but let me know if you are interested in this project :)

## Update 2023
I'm very disappointed with the behavior of people interested in the source code of this project, so I'll probably not provide access to the private repository anymore.
#### Other ways for "API"
- the have new REST API (http://www.mobile-alerts.eu)
  - Provided API is very limited. The most limiting factor is ability to retrieve only last measurement for each sensor (not able to retrieve measurements for whole hour / day etc...)
  - not implemented into this app
- there is some service conradconnect.de with support of this devices
- there is also wh-observer.de (but I'm not sure if it's compatible)
